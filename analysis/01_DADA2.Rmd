# Goals of this File

1. Use raw fastqc
2. filter and trim bad sequences
3. write out fastqs with high quality sequences
4. eval quality from filter and trim

# load libraries
``` {r load libraries}

#install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)

#devtools::install_github("benjjneb/dada2")
library(dada2)


```

# Load Data
``` {r Load Data}
# Set the raw fastq path to the raw sequencing files
# Path to the fastq files

raw_fastq_path <- "/local/workdir/es986/git_repos/SalinityGradient_16S/data/01_DADA2/01_raw_gzipped_fastqs"

# what files in this path
list.files(raw_fastq_path)

# how many files are there
str(list.files(raw_fastq_path))

#create vector or forward reads
forward_reads <- list.files(raw_fastq_path, pattern = "R1_001.fastq.gz", full.names = TRUE)
#intuition check
head(forward_reads)

#create vector of reverse reads
reverse_reads <- list.files(raw_fastq_path, pattern = "R2_001.fastq.gz", full.names = TRUE)
#intuition check
head(reverse_reads)

```

#Quality Plots
```{r raw quality plot}
# randomly select two samples from dataset to evaluate

random_samples <- sample(1:length(reverse_reads), size=2)

# calculate quality and plot of these two samples
plotQualityProfile(forward_reads[random_samples])
plotQualityProfile(reverse_reads[random_samples])
